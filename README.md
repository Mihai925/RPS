# Rock, Paper, Scissors
## How to run

For unit testing:

    $ karma start karma.conf.js

To open the app, just open index.html.

## Approach to the problem

A simple controller which takes care of managing the data and running the game once a player has chosen a weapon. The controller uses a helper function to find out the outcome of the game.

## What could be improved

*Better style (e.g. more CSS, images to represent rock, paper, scissors)
*Decision between either using a CDN or including assets (not both)
*Ability to play with another player, not just with computer. And ability to have computer vs. computer (by making use of the factory pattern)
